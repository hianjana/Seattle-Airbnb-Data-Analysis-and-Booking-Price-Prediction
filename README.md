### Motivation

The goal behind this project is get a business understanding on the data and also to predict the booking price of a new property in Airbnb Seattle. The given data is from April 2016 to February 2017 which is 11 months data.

### Business Understanding

Apart from predicting the booking price of a new property, the project explores the below areas:

1. Price overview
2. Location overview
3. Property type overview
4. Booking period overview
5. Booking price prediction

### Data Understanding

The repository contains the following files:



The files used for this project are from the open data of Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

1) listings.csv - This contains the details of all the Aribnb Seattle proprty listings.
2) calendar.csv - The dates against which each listings is already booked or availabe for booking.
3) reviews.csv - The detailed reviews for each of the listing.

Since the project is aimed at new properties,the reviews.csv or any review related data present in the listings dataset has not been used. 


### Data Preparation:

These are the high-level steps taken for data cleaning:
1. Remove data that doesnâ€™t vary (drop columns with the same value).
2. Remove data that are 100% unpopulated (drop columns with all null values).
3. Replace unpopulated data with mean/ mode (Fill nulls with the mean for numerical and mode for categorical columns).
4. Add meaningful new data using existing ones (Add new columns using some existing columns).
5. Drop irrelevant data (Since review information is not required, all review related columns are dropped. Since text mining is not used, all columns 
   with heavy text are dropped, and also url information are not required).


### Summary
1. Magnolia, Queen Anne and Downtown are the most expensive neighbourhoods in Seattle for Airbnb. Delridge is the cheapest one to stay.
2. Staying in a boat would be the costliest and staying in a dormitory will be the cheapest.
3. January is the peak month when it comes to bookings.
4. Summer is the peak season for bookings.
5. Random Forest model gives the best result for this data and can be used for further predictions.
